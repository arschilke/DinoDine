
Move the populateJSON(mDB) method to the home activity, so that as soon as we start, the tables are loaded. get it out of enter details..
(Also remove test button from ListViewActivity when it is no longer needed).

Change database from inMemory to persistent database. (Just edit AppRoomDB, but make sure DB related stuff is finished first, otherwise you can't edit DB Schema on the fly)

Make BookingViewActivity display info similar to ListViewActivity,

?Load up some test data intially, so you can see / interact with tables and bookings without first making 20 odd bookings for demo..

SelectDateActivity, check that date is >= to currentDate.. so no bookings allowed in the past..

Make a function that goes through and deletes all entries [allocations, bookings and then guests so foreign key constraints are met] before today's date, so past bookings automatically clear themselves..
//should this be saved in another database to keep track of records? and just have a 'working' set of bookings that are relevant for restaurant.

If booking Date == todays Date, then check that startTime for booking is after (>=) to currentTime. At the moment it only checks that end time is after startTime.


WAS there a another page we were supposed to have, where you could click on it and edit details? or even delete allocations/bookings/guests? ??
